/*
PROBLEM:
A double number is an even-length number whose left-side digits are exactly the
same as its right-side digits. For example, 44, 3333, 103103, and 7676 are all
double numbers, whereas 444, 334433, and 107 are not.

Write a function that returns the number provided as an argument multiplied by
two, unless the argument is a double number; return double numbers as-is.
